# JUET-Past-Year-s-Papers
The dreaded T1, T2, and T3 examination's papers come here to die.
## About ⚡:
Up until 2012, our university folks used to maintain an archive of all the exam papers that were held all year around. That's not the case anymore. A week before each exam, I have seen students spending a majority of their time anxiously hunting for previous year's papers from their seniors. However, one couldn't easily get their hands these papers and the students who did, would only circulate it amongst their group, and increasing chances of scorng better.

That is when I thought of creating this repository to solve these problems. It will not only put all the past year's papers at your disposal but would also level the playing field for all.
## What you'll get here 🤑:
- Anytime, anywhere and unlimited access to all the T1, T2, T3 papers from several years.
- Learn to make open source contributions (optional, more about this in the next section).
- Via your open source contributions, you can improve your github profile (get badges, increase pull request count and more).

## How you can give back 🤝🏻: 
This idea and repository can only thrive with the help of the community. I can only do so much myself and once I pass out, it will be upto the college students to maintain it. I urge and request everyone to contribute to this repo with the papers you have at present so that we can keep it up and running for our upcoming juniors.
